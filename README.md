# RestaurantOrderingSystem

# Purpose and Features
An exercise in full-stack development, using a separately-deployable Rails-based REST API and Vue front-end. The API supports authn/z, multiple user roles (restaurant owners and consumers), an order-processing stepwise workflow, and basic menu and order creation. 

The app provides login/out, restaurant/menu browsing, a cart experience, and has a basic level of responsiveness. Styling, such as it is, is via Bootstrap.

# Production deployment
This is nowhere near production-ready.

The functionality is minimal (ask me about shortcomings!) - this is a project done after-hours in a bit over a week, in part as an exercise to re-familiarize with a few techs.
